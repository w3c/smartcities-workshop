          <p>"Smart Cities" refers to a range of technologies and processes for intelligent management of our built and inhabited environment. 
           As interest rises, we see prospects for smarter and easier integration of various technologies from multiple vendors related to IoT devices and Web services. </p>
           
            <p>Several <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#smart-city">preliminary use cases on Smart Cities</a> have been discussed within the Web of Thing (WoT) IG as part of the WoT standardization based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/minutes.html#day2-item02">proposal during the Second WoT Workshop in Munich</a>.
<!--
              However, Smart Cities include various technologies, of which WoT is just one. We would therefore like to create a dedicated W3C Interest Group:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>to identify and document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services,</li>
              <li>to obtain feedback from all stakeholders on the usage of Web technologies for Smart Cities,</li>
              <li>to gather expert input on important features for Smart Cities based on Web technology, and</li>
              <li>to provide a forum for technical and business discussions related to Smart Cities.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We've generated an <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">initial draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a>. 
            We would like to collect even more use cases along with concrete system implementation experiences from all over the world, since uses may depend on cities' locations, cultures, etc., and include various sub-systems from many different vendors. 
            Therefore we'd like to hold a dedicated W3C workshop on the possible standardization for Smart Cities.</p>

          <p>As cities include diverse populations including people with disabilities, we need to account for accessibility as well as security, privacy protection and multi-language support and security for Smart Cities.</p>

          <p>The Web has become a platform for various industries and services including payments and commerce, publishing, media distribution, video conferencing and connected cars, and it's becoming a promising platform for IoT interoperability, as mentioned in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/04/pressrelease-wot-rec.html.en">Web of Things Press Release in April 2020</a>. Also there is an expectation for the Web of Things standards to be applied to integration of huge numbers of sub-systems for Smart City services. We've been generating a <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Charter for a potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a> to (1) introduce the W3C as a place to have discussions on interoperability for Smart City services and (2) document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services.</p>
-->
          However, Smart Cities include various technologies, of which WoT is just one. So W3C organized a virtual online workshop on Smart Cities in June 2021 to finalize this Charter for the Smart Cities Interest Group to collect input from the Smart Citeis stakeholders.

<p>During the workshop discussion, we did the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identified Smart Cities standardization stakeholders to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities</li>
    <li>Clarified reasonable applications for Smart Cities technologies</li>
    <li>Saw how to improve the draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group for further discussions within that IG</li>
</ul>

<p>We also confirmed that it would be very important to consider
    inclusive design including accessibility, privacy, security, and
    internationalization. Smart City applications are tightly
    related to the people who live in cities.  We want Smart City
    technology to have a positive impact on their lives and want to avoid
    unintended negative consequences.</p>

<p>The goal of the group is not to generate standard itself, but to
gather pain points, requirements and priorities for Web-based smart
cities in the near future. So we need to figure out the focus that W3C
can make the most impact. We don't want to duplicate work already done
by the other SDOs.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p><!-- Brief background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry. -->

            <p><em>Note: This charter was drawn up as an outcome of the June 2021 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/06/smartcities-workshop/report.html">W3C Workshop on Smart Cities</a>.</em></p>

            <div class="summary">
                <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">Scope Summary</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
                    <li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities (Technology Landscape)</li>
                    <li>Best Practices on what technologies, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web, to be applied for what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management.</li>
                    <li>Use cases and requirements for Smart Cities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <p>Standards are essential for Smart City technology and business development.
        Standards benefit vendors, cities, and users.
        For vendors, standards unify markets and mean that a larger market can be addressed
        with a single product design, allowing products to more efficiently make returns on
        the investments needed to develop them. 
        For cities, standards allow the deployment of technologies that can be sourced 
        from multiple vendors,
        more and higher quality products,
        and increases the probability that systems will remain usable over a longer timescale.
        Standards also encourage the development of open systems that can interoperate
        with other standardized systems, 
        multiplying the number of use cases that can be addressed.
        For users, standardized technologies mean that services available in one city will
        also be available in others, facilitating mobility.
        </p>
        <p>However, we need to know what standards should be developed to achieve these
        objectives.  What gaps exist?  What opportunities can be exposed by standards 
        that enable new use cases?  What are the business drivers that encourage adoption
        of standards, and how can standard development be aligned with these drivers?
        Given a set of standards that could be developed, what are the priorities?
        How can the needs and goals of all stakeholders be aligned?
        </p>
        <p>The purpose of this Interest Group is collect and connect
        Smart City stakeholders to answer these kinds of questions
        and drive the development of Web technology standards aligned with the real needs
        of Smart Cities.</p>

        <p>The topics that the Interest Group will address include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Transportation, 
              both public and private;</li>
          <li>Logistics, 
              including last-mile delivery of goods and services;</li>
          <li>Infrastructure, 
              including IoT-based sensing and actuation;</li>
          <li>Energy management and sustainability;</li>
          <li>Connection between crimate crisis and smart cities;</li>
          <li>Relationship with Smart Buildings as part of the geolocation things like location of pipes;</li>
          <li>Signage, 
              addressing the problem of timely delivery of information to a diverse population;</li>
          <li>Open data portals,
              including network APIs to data services and the development of app ecosystems;</li>
          <li>Data management,
              facilitating the rapid ingestion, storage, and dissemination of data</li>
              </li>
          <li>Edge and cloud computing,
              allowing computation to be efficiently applied when and where needed;
              </li>
          <li>Payments,
              to allow services to be monetized, encouraging new business development and
              cost recovery;</li>
          <li>Privacy,
              to preserve the rights of citizens and other stakeholders;</li>
          <li>Security,
              to preserve the integrity and safety of systems and protect users;</li>
          <li>Accessibility,
	            to incorporate design-for-all thinking throughout all
	            aspects of smart city infrastructure, and ensure
	            accessibility for people with disabilities in every
	            activity and at every stage of life;</li>
	        <li>Internationalization,
              to support diverse populations and tourism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can speculate about many topics, so need to identfy what the group's key topics are and see what would fit with W3C through the discussion with the existing smart cities.</p>

        <p>The main tasks that the Interest Group will undertake include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
          <li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities (Technology Landscape)</li>
          <li>Best Practices on what technologies, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web, to be applied for what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management.</li>
          <li>Smart Cities use cases to which Web technologies are applicable and requirements to provide better support for high priority use cases</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The group should also consider the following when work on the above tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identification and prioritization of gaps in Web standards for Smart City use cases;</li>
          <li>Incubation of technical solutions for the identified requirements by
            supporting the creation of Community Groups or Business Groups focusing on
            particular topics;
          </li>
          <li>Suggesting existing Working Groups to include particular topics in
            their scope as appropriate;</li>
          <li>Suggesting the creation of new Working Groups to address particular topics if no
            existing Working Group is appropriate;</li>
          <li>Tracking and review of Smart City-related deliverables developed by
            other W3C groups, and reporting of issues as appropriate;</li>
          <li>Coordination with other organizations to
            gather knowledge, coordinate input into W3C efforts, and promote
            development and use of W3C standards within Smart City applications;</li>
          <li>Ensuring issues of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, performance, privacy, and security are given
          equal consideration in all discussions and outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Accessibility is very important for smart cities because
            cities include many people potentially with disabilities. So
            we need to look for "missing data" within smart cities,
            i.e., data of those who might not be well-represented among
            the data-sets, to ensure that they are surely recognized and
            well-served by the smart cities.
            For that purpose, we need to consider people with multiple disabilities (intersectional considerations) and
            people with cognitive and learning disabilities too.
        </p>

        <p>Note that there are many topics to discuss around Smart
            Cities and the scope of the group may become too
            broad, so we would like to focus on data governance and privacy management for the first year based on the discussion during the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/06/smartcities-workshop/report.html">workshop</a>.</p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <p>Smart Cities vary widely and diversely. So we can wander into all sorts of areas if we don't get the right regulators to hear where they care. Terefore we need to make sure the group enrolls the support of implementers, the authorities and cities to get them involved to help set prioritization.</p>
    <p>For that purpose, we need to identify important stakeholders and would start with a smaller team, e.g., Asian stakeholders like Singapore, Japan, China and Korea, and involve more countries/cities like Sweden, Brazil and NYC via the collaboration with the W3C Chapters and the attendees of the <a href=" https://www.w3.org/2021/06/smartcities-workshop/attendees.html">Smart Cities Workshop in June 2021</a> and the TPAC breakout sessions in October 2021 (<a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/10/18-smart-cities-minutes.html">Day 1</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/10/21-smart-cities-minutes.html">Day 2</a>).</p>

          <p>The Interest Group will have succeeded if it can achieve the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
          <li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities (Technology Landscape)</li>
          <li>Best Practices on what technologies, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web, to be applied for what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management.</li>
          <li>Use cases and requirements for Smart Cities</li>
          </ul>
          <!--
          <ul>
            <li>Participation via mailing list subscription and postings from people
              representing various stakeholder communities, including equipment vendors,
              governments, regulators, hardware and software developers, users, and citizens.
            </li>
            <li>Members of the Interest Group starting or joining relevant Working Groups 
              and driving the development of work items for W3C Recommendations.
            </li>
            <li>Members of the Interest Group starting or joining relavant 
              Interest, Community, or Business Groups
              and contributing to the creation of W3C Notes.</li>
            <li>Constructive feedback on W3C deliverables posted for review on the
              <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-smart-cities/">Smart Cities IG mailing list</a>.
              <br><strong>Note: link is a placeholder, may change, and is currently not active.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Engagement and coordination with other organizations to promote alignment with 
            and adherence to W3C standards.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To achieve this, the Interest Group will organize regular
          conference calls to update members on progress of work items, and to
          invite other groups and organizations to present their work to
          Interest Group participants.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants 
          for its duration.
          The chairs and editors are expected to contribute half of a working day per week 
          towards the Interest Group. 
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, 
          comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, 
          as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions 
          for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required 
          (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: 
          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived 
          for public review, 
          and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that 
          can be both read and written to by the general public. 
          Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of deliverables will be developed on a 
          public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
          The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group 
          (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, 
          participants, and meetings) 
          will be available from the <a href="">Smart Cities Interest Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Smart City Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of 
          particular deliverables, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list 
          for administrative purposes and,

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, 
          per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> 
          W3C Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. 
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal,
          which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not 
          achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented,
          the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation,
          any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting
          or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions 
          (for example, via email, GitHub issue or Web-based survey),
          with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>,
          depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period,
          the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the 
          Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until 
          new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the 
          Chairs or the Director.
