        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>

        <h3>Initial discussion during the Smart Citeis Worshop in 2021</h3>
        <p>"Smart Cities" refers to a range of technologies and processes for intelligent management of our built and inhabited environment. As interest rises, we see prospects for smarter and easier integration of various technologies from multiple vendors related to IoT devices and Web services.</p>

        <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#smart-city">Several preliminary use cases on Smart Cities</a> have been discussed within the Web of Thing (WoT) IG as part of the WoT standardization based on the proposal during the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/minutes.html#day2-item02">Second WoT Workshop in Munich</a>.</p>

        <p>However, Smart Cities include various technologies, of which WoT is just one. So W3C organized a virtual online workshop on Smart Cities in June 2021 to finalize this Charter for the Smart Cities Interest Group to collect input from the Smart Cities stakeholders.</p>

        <p>During the workshop discussion, we did the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identified Smart Cities standardization stakeholders to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities</li>
            <li>Clarified reasonable applications for Smart Cities technologies</li>
            <li>Saw how to improve the draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group for further discussions within that IG</li>
            <li>We also confirmed that it would be very important to consider inclusive design including accessibility, privacy, security, and internationalization. Smart City applications are tightly related to the people who live in cities. We want Smart City technology to have a positive impact on their lives and want to avoid unintended negative consequences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Follow-up discussion during the TPAC 2022 breakout, etc.</h3>
        <p>Follow-up discussion on Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities was organized at (1) the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/09/14-smartcities-minutes.html">breakout session during TPAC 2022</a> in Vancouver, Canada and (2) another <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/09/13-smartcities-minutes.html">breakout session during TPAC 2023</a> in Seville, Spain, and representatives from the following standardization organizations discussed the current situation and problems of their standardization work on Smart Cities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ECHONET</li>
            <li>IEC SC3D</li>
            <li>IPA DADC</li>
            <li>ISO/IEC JTC1 WG11</li>
            <li>ITU-T SG20</li>
            <li>OGC (Open Geospaital Consortium)</li>
            <li>W3C</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a consequence, the participatns identified that "Digital Twins" would be the key cocept to handle Smart Cities services in a standardizedmanner, and got consensusto continue further discussion on a possible framework of Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities within the W3C to cope with remaining issues of Smart Cities.</p>

        <h3>What has been done so far</h3>
        <h4>W3C Web of Things</h4>
        <p>IoT developers face the big problem of “IoT Silos” when creating an
            application including multiple services from different IoT platforms.</p>

        <figure>
        <img class="diagram" alt="IoT Silos" src="./20181203-iot-silos-e.png" width="45%" />
        <figcaption>IoT Silos</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) Working Group has been working on standards to counter the fragmentation of the IoT and enable easy integration of IoT devices and services across IoT platforms and application domains by providing a common description across different ecosystems (=WoT Thing Description), standards.</p>

        <figure>
        <img class="diagram" alt="Interconnection using WoT" src="./20181203-plugfest-e.png" width="60%" />
        <figcaption>Interconnection of IoT platforms using WoT as a hub</figcaption>
        </figure>

         <p>WoT standards are now being used for various industry areas including the following:/p>
         <dl>
             <dt>Smart home (collaboratively with ECHONET)</dt>
             <dd>Improve the usability of home appliances for device users by allowing device users to configure the operation modes of all devices at home without configuring those devices one by one when they leave and come home.</dd>

             <dt>Smart building (collaboratively with IPA DADC)</dt>
             <dd>Integrate various sensor networks and various devices by WoT within a smart building which use different data models and protocols.</dd>

             <dt>Smart factory (collaboratively with OPC UA)</dt>
             <dd>A bottling line consists of a filling module, a capping module, a labeling module, and a transport system. The production line is provided via an OPC UA endpoint for control and monitoring purposes.</dd>


             <h3>Related SDO's work</h3>
             <dl>
                 <dt>IEC SC3D's Common Data Dictionary (CDD)</dt>
                 <dd>Defining common methodology and product ontology for various IoT purposes.</dd>

                 <dt>ISO/IEC JTC1 WG11</dt>
                 <dd>Various standards on smart cities and digital twins, e.g., ISO/IEC 30146:2019</dd>

                 <dt>ITU-T SG20</dt>
                 <dd>Standardization on IoT and Smart Cities from the ICT viewpoint, e.g., Data Processing and Management (FG-DPM)</dd>

                 <dt>Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)</dt>
                 <dd>Geospatial standards and tools around smart cities and digital twins</dd>
             </dl>

             <h3>What is still missing?</h3>
             <p>During the discussions so far, there are strong needs for the followings:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Guidelines for real-world engineering, e.g., for Device discovery</li>
                 <li>Inter-system binding including ID authentication and management</li>
                 <li>Data transfer and distribution including Governance of data distribution, Security and Privacy</li>
                 <li>Semantic interoperability, Standardized vocabulary, and Catalog to start with the data search</li>
                 <li>Accessibility, Geolocation, etc.</li>
             </ul>

             <h3>“Digital Twins” as the Key Concept</h3>
             <p>During the discussions at the TPAC 2022 breakout, it was identified “Digital Twins” would be the key concept for Smart Cities services, and we should start with clarifying the use cases and requirements for “Digital Twins” first.</p>

             <p>Note that there are various definitions for "Digital Twins" all over the world. However, given the collaborative discussion with ITU-T SG20 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG11 starting with the Smart Cities Workshop, we'd like to use the following basic definition from "<a href="https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=18456">Y.4605</a>" as the starting point.</p>

                 <blockquote cite="https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=18456">
                 <header>Basic Definition of "Digital Twins"</header>
                 <p>A digital twin is the digital representation of an object of interest with data connection that enables convergence between the physical state and digital state at an appropriate rate of synchronization. The digital twin has been applied in various industry domains including manufacturing, transportation, energy, firefighting, medical and safety.</p>

                 <figcaption>Digital Twin Framework</figcaption>
                 </figure>

                 <p>Digital Twin framework provides a method to applications to handle physical devices by controlling the digital representations of the physical deives on the digital layer based on tha data connection between the digital representations and the physical devices.</p>

                 <p>A possible data connection mechanism for Web-based Digital Twins, which was agreed on during the TPAC 2022 breakout, consists of the following three W3C standards:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Decentralized Identifiers (DID): define IDs to identify devices and users on the digigal layer</li>
                     <li>Web of Things (WoT): define the capability of physical devices so that they can be handled by applications on the digigal layer</li>
                     <li>Verifiable Credentials (VC): standardized description about user credentials to see what the users can/can't do with the devices on the digigal layer</li>
                 </ul>

                 <figure>

-->

           <p>During the group's discussion, we’ll see the other existing definitions of "Digital Twins" from the other SDOs and actual Smart Cities, and work on further clarifications about the definition of “Web-based Digital Twins”.</p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
            <div class="summary">
                <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">Scope Summary</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
                    <li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities, e.g., possible building blocks of Digital Twin Framework and standardized Vocabularies for Smart Cities</li>
                    <li>Best Practices on what kind of technologies to be applied to what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web to be applied to improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management</li>
                    <li>Use cases and requirements for Smart Cities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <p>Standards are essential for Smart City technology and business development.
        Standards benefit vendors, cities, and users.
        For vendors, standards unify markets and mean that a larger market can be addressed
        with a single product design, allowing products to more efficiently make returns on
        the investments needed to develop them. 
        For cities, standards allow the deployment of technologies that can be sourced 
        from multiple vendors,
        more and higher quality products,
        and increases the probability that systems will remain usable over a longer timescale.
        Standards also encourage the development of open systems that can interoperate
        with other standardized systems, 
        multiplying the number of use cases that can be addressed.
        For users, standardized technologies mean that services available in one city will
        also be available in others, facilitating mobility.
        </p>
        <p>However, we need to know what standards should be developed to achieve these
        objectives.  What gaps exist?  What opportunities can be exposed by standards 
        that enable new use cases?  What are the business drivers that encourage adoption
        of standards, and how can standard development be aligned with these drivers?
        Given a set of standards that could be developed, what are the priorities?
        How can the needs and goals of all stakeholders be aligned?
        </p>
        <p>The purpose of this Interest Group is collect and connect
        Smart City stakeholders to answer these kinds of questions
        and drive the development of Web technology standards aligned with the real needs
        of Smart Cities.</p>

        <p>The topics that the Interest Group will address include but are not limited to:</p>

          <li>Edge and cloud computing,
              allowing computation to be efficiently applied when and where needed;
              </li>
          <li>Payments,
              to allow services to be monetized, encouraging new business development and
              cost recovery;</li>
          <li>Privacy,
              to preserve the rights of citizens and other stakeholders;</li>
          <li>Security,
              to preserve the integrity and safety of systems and protect users;</li>
          <li>Accessibility,
	            to incorporate design-for-all thinking throughout all
	            aspects of smart city infrastructure, and ensure
	            accessibility for people with disabilities in every
	            activity and at every stage of life;</li>
	        <li>Internationalization,
              to support diverse populations and tourism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can speculate about many topics, so need to identfy what the group's key topics are and see what would fit with W3C through the discussion with the existing smart cities. Note that the topics listed above are related to each other, so the relationship among multiple topics should be described as concrete use cases, e.g., which topics to be considered in what kind of situation.</p>

        <p>The main tasks that the Interest Group will undertake include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
          <li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities (Technology Landscape)</li>
          <li>Best Practices on what technologies, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web, to be applied for what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management.</li>
          <li>Smart Cities use cases to which Web technologies are applicable and requirements to provide better support for high priority use cases</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The group should also consider the following when work on the above tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identification and prioritization of gaps in Web standards for Smart City use cases;</li>
          <li>Incubation of technical solutions for the identified requirements by
            supporting the creation of Community Groups or Business Groups focusing on
            particular topics;
          </li>
          <li>Suggesting existing Working Groups to include particular topics in
            their scope as appropriate;</li>
          <li>Suggesting the creation of new Working Groups to address particular topics if no
            existing Working Group is appropriate;</li>
          <li>Tracking and review of Smart City-related deliverables developed by
            other W3C groups, and reporting of issues as appropriate;</li>
          <li>Coordination with other organizations to
            gather knowledge, coordinate input into W3C efforts, and promote
            development and use of W3C standards within Smart City applications;</li>
          <li>Ensuring issues of accessibility, device independence,
          internationalization, performance, privacy, and security are given
          equal consideration in all discussions and outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Accessibility is very important for smart cities because
            cities include many people potentially with disabilities. So
            we need to look for "missing data" within smart cities,
            i.e., data of those who might not be well-represented among
            the data-sets, to ensure that they are surely recognized and
            well-served by the smart cities.
            For that purpose, we need to consider people with multiple disabilities (intersectional considerations) and
            people with cognitive and learning disabilities too.
        </p>

        <p>Note that there are many topics to discuss around Smart Cities and
            the scope of the group may become too broad.

        So we'd like to start with discussion about the following two points:
        <ol>
            <li> what a Web-based Digital Twin framework for for Smart Cities should be like based on the possible Web-based Data Connection Framework for Digital Twins in section 1.6 "Digital Twins” as the Key Concept" above</li>
            <li> standardized vocabulary for Smart Cities based on the feedback from the Smart Cities stakeholders including the related SDOs and actual Smart Cities</li>
        </ol>

        <!--
        <p>To continue further discussion on the common Web-based platform and standardized vocabulary, we'd like to launch a dedicated group:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to identify and document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services,</li>
            <li>to obtain feedback from all stakeholders on the usage of Web technologies for Smart Cities,</li>
            <li>to gather expert input on important features for Smart Cities based on the Web technology, and to provide a forum for technical and business discussions related to Smart Cities.</li>
        </ul>
        -->

                <p>The goal of the group is not to generate standard itself, but to gather pain points, requirements and priorities for Web-based smart cities in the near future. So we need to figure out the focus that W3C can make the most impact. We don't want to duplicate work already done by the other SDOs.</p>

	<section id="success-criteria">
	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <p>Smart Cities vary widely and diversely. So we can wander into all sorts of areas if we don't get the right regulators to hear where they care. Terefore we need to make sure the group enrolls the support of implementers, the authorities and cities to get them involved to help set prioritization.</p>

    <p>For that purpose, we need to identify important stakeholders and would start with a smaller team, e.g., Asian stakeholders like Singapore, Japan, China and Korea, and involve more countries/cities like Sweden, Brazil and NYC via the collaboration with the W3C Chapters and the attendees of the <a href=" https://www.w3.org/2021/06/smartcities-workshop/attendees.html">Smart Cities Workshop in June 2021</a> and the TPAC breakout sessions in October 2021 (<a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/10/18-smart-cities-minutes.html">Day 1</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/10/21-smart-cities-minutes.html">Day 2</a>).</p>

    <p>The Interest Group will have succeeded if it can achieve the following:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
         <li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities (Technology Landscape)</li>
         <li>Best Practices on what technologies, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web, to be applied for what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management.</li>
         <li>Use cases and requirements for Smart Cities</li>

The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.

           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.

        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/[shortname]/ipr">licensing information</a>.</p>
