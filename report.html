<h2 id="summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>W3C organized a virtual online workshop on Smart Cities on 25 June
2021 to improve and finalize the description of the
<a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Charter for a potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a> so that we can (1) introduce the W3C as a place to have discussions on interoperability for Smart City services and (2) document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services.</p>

<p>During the W3C Workshop discussion, we did the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identified Smart Cities standardization stakeholders to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities</li>
    <li>Clarified reasonable applications for Smart Cities technologies</li>
    <li>Saw how to improve the draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group for further discussions within that IG</li>
</ul>

<p>We also confirmed that it would be very important to consider
    inclusive design including accessibility, privacy, security, and
    internationalization. Smart City applications are tightly
    related to the people who live in cities.  We want Smart City
    technology to have a positive impact on their lives and want to avoid
    unintended negative consequences.</p>

<p>Following the workshop, as a concrete next step, the W3C will finalize
    the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">
    draft Charter for a potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a>
    and launch the group to start further discussion on the use cases
    and requirements for Smart Cities as well as survey existing
    technologies and standards for Smart Cities.

    Note that we will closely liaise with
    various cities which are already working on Smart City services as well as
    related SDOs, e.g., OGC, ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC JTC1, BSI, ETSI, IETF and ITU.</p>


<h2 id="sessions">Workshop Sessions</h2>
<p>The workshop consisted of three separate sessions due to
        participation from various locations.  The format worked very
        well to let all the speakers and other attendees to participate
        in the workshop discussion regardless of their timezones.
        All sessions were recorded.
</p>

<p>Each of the three sessions had the following sub-sessions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scene setting: Goals and expectations for the workshop</li>
    <li>Use Cases</li>
    <li>Existing standards</li>
    <li>Proposals for Web-based approaches</li>
    <li>Cross-cutting issues for smart cities</li>
    <li>Wrap-up</li>
</ul>

<p>During each sub-session above, we specifically talked about the most
important requirements for the draft Smart Cities IG Charter.
And then at the end of each session, we summarized what we discussed
during the workshop.
In addition, at the end of the final third session, we confirmed a
dedicated discussion group is needed for further discussion and what needs to
    be added to the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Smart Cities IG Charter</a></p>

<p>The summary of each session is available below. Please see also the detailed <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/06/25-smart-cities-minutes.html">minutes from the workshop</a>.</p>
