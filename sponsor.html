      <h2 id="why">Why Sponsor This Workshop?</h2>
      <p>The cost to hold this virtual workshop includes costs for post-processing the pre-recorded talks (captioning, video/slides synchronization, packaging) and other considerations.</p>

      <p>Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without sponsorships, W3C cannot hold workshops.</p>

      <p>If you see value in discussing possible standardization of the expected W3C Smart Cities Interest Group &amp; Web-based Smart Cities in general, and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the technical evolution of the Web.</p>
