        <section>
          <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
          <p>"Smart Cities" refers to a range of technologies and processes for intelligent management of our built and inhabited environment. 
           As interest rises, we see prospects for smarter and easier integration of various technologies from multiple vendors related to IoT devices and Web services. </p>
           
            <p>Several <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#smart-city">use cases on Smart Cities</a> have been discussed within the Web of Thing (WoT) IG as part of the WoT standardization based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/minutes.html#day2-item02">proposal during the Second WoT Workshop in Munich</a>.
              However, Smart Cities include various technologies, of which WoT is just one. We would therefore like to create a dedicated W3C Interest Group:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>to identify and document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services,</li>
              <li>to obtain feedback from all stakeholders on the usage of Web technologies for Smart Cities,</li>
              <li>to gather expert input on important features for Smart Cities based on Web technology, and</li>
              <li>to provide a forum for technical and business discussions related to Smart Cities.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We've generated an <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">initial draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a>. 
            We would like to collect even more use cases along with concrete system implementation experiences from all over the world, since uses may depend on cities' locations, cultures, etc., and include various sub-systems from many different vendors. 
            Therefore we'd like to hold a dedicated W3C workshop on the possible standardization for Smart Cities.</p>

          <p>As cities include diverse populations including people with disabilities, we need to account for accessibility as well as security, privacy protection and multi-language support and security for Smart Cities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
          <p>The Web has become a platform for various industries and services including payments and commerce, publishing, media distribution, video conferencing and connected cars, and it's becoming a promising platform for IoT interoperability, as mentioned in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/04/pressrelease-wot-rec.html.en">Web of Things Press Release in April 2020</a>. Also there is an expectation for the Web of Things standards to be applied to integration of huge numbers of sub-systems for Smart City services. We've been generating a <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Charter for a potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a> to (1) introduce the W3C as a place to have discussions on interoperability for Smart City services and (2) document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services.</p>

          <p>Now we would like to improve and finalize the description of the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft IG Charter</a>. In this W3C Workshop, we aim to see what can be done with existing Web standards, and what is still missing from the web that would help people to implement Smart Cities.</p>

          <p>The goals of the workshop are:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Identify stakeholders of Smart Cities standardization to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities</li>
              <li>Clarify reasonable applications for Smart Cities technologies we agree to build</li>
              <li>and then see how to improve the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a> for further discussions within that IG</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As Smart Cities' applications are tightly related to the people who live in cities, and potentially would have negative impacts on their lives, it is very important to begin from inclusive design, including accessibility, privacy and security as well as internationalization.</p>

            <p>
                W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
                communities to help structure productive discussions around existing
                and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework
                for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser)
                technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or
                “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of
                our members and our community.
