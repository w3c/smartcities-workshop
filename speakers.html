              <li>Clarify reasonable applications for Smart Cities technologies we agree to build</li>
              <li>and then see how to improve the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html">draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group</a> for further discussions within that IG</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please see also the <a href="index.html#topics">detailed topic list</a> for the workshop.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=submit>How to apply to speak?</h2>
          <p>Please submit your proposal using the "<a href="#submit-form">Submit a talk proposal form</a>" on this page <strong>before 10 May 2021</strong> (<span class="updates">deadline extended based on the requests from potential speakers</span>). We will work with you in confirming and defining your proposed contribution. You may also contact the <a href="mailto:group-smartcity-ws-pc@w3.org">Program Committee</a> by email directly at any time if you have any questions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=why>Why should I apply to speak?</h2>
          <p>Your audience, the workshop participants, will include varioustakeholders of Smart Cities including Users from various countries and communities, Government agencies, Smart City system developers, Experts on accessibility, egal and civil society.</p>

          <p>Bringing your perspective to this workshop provides a unique opportunity to have a global and lasting impact on the future standization for Web-based Smart Cities.</p>

          <p>This will also help you establish contacts with new communities and new experts, expanding your network of experts and business relations.</p>

          <p>Beyond the workshop itself, the record of the presentation will be available on the W3C site as part of the event record, and will serve as a point of reference and discussion for the years to come.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=what>What should my talk cover?</h2>
          <p>The Program Committee will review proposed talks to assess they fit well with the call for participation, in particular the <a href="index.html#goals">goals of the workshop</a> and the <a href="index.html#topics">list of possible topics</a>.</p>

          <p>Once selected, speakers should aim to provide a talk that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>brings their specific perspective on the topic,</li>
            <li>identifies what barriers and gaps may need to be resolved to make the Web a promising platform for integrating various Smart City applications and services, in particular from the view point of the <a href="index.html#goals">goals</a> and the <a href="index.html#topics">topics</a> of the workshop,</li>
            <li>shed light on specific aspects or questions the Program Committee will have raised in their review process,</li>
            <li>raise questions of their own that other Workshop participants may usefully provide input on.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Talks are expected to be in the 5 to 10 minutes time range, to ensure as many workshop participants as possible can watch all the submitted talks prior to the live discussions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=how>How will talks be recorded and presented?</h2>
          <p>Once approved by the Program Committee, talks are expected to be delivered as a combination of a slideset (in HTML or PDF) and a recorded audio or video of the speaker (<strong>without</strong> screen recording of the slides) <strong>before 11 June 2021</strong>.</p>

          <p>These two elements will then be synchronized and combined to allow Workshop participants to watch presentations at their own pace - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/05/AC/talk/strategy-funnel">an example of this synchronized presentation viewer</a> for a previous W3C event.</p>

          <p>You can find W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Virtual_Presentations">guidance on tools and tips</a> to record yourself. As an alternative, the Program Committee will offer to record speakers over a teleconferencing system (e.g. Zoom) both to help with technical matters and to provide an audience to the speaker, since we recognize that speaking alone in front of a camera is not necessarily an easy exercise.</p>

          <p>W3C provides also <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Speaker_Resources">more general guidance on how to present effectively</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible.php#during">in a way accessible to people with disabilities</a>.</p>
          <p>Talks are expected to be delivered in English.</p>

          <p>W3C will provide transcripts and captions for all the selected presentations and will ask speakers' help in reviewing these for accuracy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=other>What other commitments are expected from me if I give a talk?</h2>
          <p>After all the pre-recorded talks have been published on the W3C site, the Program Committee will set up a teleconference on 25 June 2021 where each of the workshop topics will get discussed, as informed by the submitted presentations.</p>
          <p>Speakers are expected to the best of their availability to be on the call where the topic of their presentation is being discussed, to answer and raise questions with other workshop participants.</p>
          <p>The Program Committee will also set up asynchronous communication mechanisms (email, GitHub issues, Slack, etc.) where speakers are cordially invited to participate to exchange with other speakers and workshop participants.</p>
